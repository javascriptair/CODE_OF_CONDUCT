# JavaScript Air Code of Conduct

JavaScript Air follows the
[contributor-covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/code_of_conduct.md)
code of conduct. In addition to what is listed there, please keep the
following points in mind when on the JavaScript Air show:

- Avoid the use of offensive language (curse words are unacceptable on this show)
- Opinions are great. Please express them in a way that is not unkind to
  alternate opinions.
- Hopefully I don't have a reason to add anything else here...
